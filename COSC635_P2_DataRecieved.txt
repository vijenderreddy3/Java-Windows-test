   Session Description Protocol (SDP) Media Capabilities Negotiation

Abstract

   Session Description Protocol (SDP) capability negotiation provides a
   general framework for indicating and negotiating capabilities in SDP.
   The base framework defines only capabilities for negotiating
   transport protocols and attributes.  This documents extends the
   framework by defining media capabilities that can be used to
   negotiate media types and their associated parameters.
